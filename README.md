# FraudSheild : Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A machine learning-based project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a highly imbalanced dataset and deployed using Flask for real-time web-based predictions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Built a classification model to detect fraud using anonymized credit card transaction data.
- Compared **six different machine learning algorithms** and found **Random Forest** performed best with an accuracy of **99.95%**.
- The system is deployed using **Flask** with a simple and interactive **HTML/CSS/JS frontend**.
- Real-time predictions are made based on user input, making the system practical and testable.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning & Python Details

### ðŸ”¶ Dataset:
- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains 284,807 transactions with only 492 fraud cases (highly imbalanced)
- Features: V1â€“V28 (PCA transformed), Amount, Time
- Target: `Class` (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

### ðŸ”¶ Algorithms Compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- **Random Forest** (Best Performance)

### ðŸ”¶ Model Evaluation:
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Special focus on **Recall for Class 1 (fraud)** to minimize false negatives

### ðŸ”¶ Preprocessing:
- Checked for null values: `df.isnull().sum()`
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler` if needed
- Handled class imbalance using techniques like **under-sampling** (optional)

### ðŸ”¶ Model Saving:
```python
import pickle
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
